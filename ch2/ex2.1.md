+ Difference between `int`, `long`, `long long`, and `short`
    + Size are different
        + int - 16 bits
        + short - 16 bits
        + long - 32 bits
        + long long - 64 bits
    + But they all represent signed integer 

+ Difference between `unsigned` and a `signed` type
    + `unsigned` - no signed bit at the left, starts from 0 to MAXIMUM
    + `signed` - has signed bit at the left

+ Differrence between `float` and `double`
    + They both represent floating number
    + They have different size
        + `float` - 32 bits and less precision
        + `double` - 64 bits and more precision
